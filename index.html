			<h1>#HereToStay</h1>
				<p>On September 5th the Trump administration announced it would end DACA, a program that provides temporary protection to undocumented migrants who came to the country as children, allowing them to work, live and study in the US without the constant fear of being deported. If Congress doesn’t act, this move will mean DACA recipients will be eligible for deportation, losing everything they and their parents fought for.<br><br>It’s time to push congress to take the morally and economically right desicion: to not only defend DACA, but also to deliver a more expansive legislature that legalizes Dreamers and provides protection to more of them, without determining any group of people to exclude.<br><br><b>We are strong. We are resilient. We are here to stay.</b></p>
